# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
- The motivation behind this project was to create a webpage to act as a study guide to track everything I learned during the prework modules for this coding 
    bootcamp. It contains notes on what I learned during the prework and is divided into four sections: HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. Additionally, the creaton of this app served as an opportunity to learn about each of these concepts.

- I built this project as a way to keep my notes in one organized (and easy-to-access) location. I also used it as a way to learn more about using HTML, 
    CSS, Git, and JavaScript

- It solves the problem of having to sort through un-organized notes to review what I learned during this prework session.

- I learned how to combine CSS, HTML, and JavaScript together to create a functional website. I also learned how to use Git and GitHub to add 
    version-control to projects.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
The app can be accessed through a web browser. Once opened, you can see four sections representing the four main topics covered in the prework. Each section contains an unordered list of notes covering things I learned about each of these topics. Additionally, there is a message promting the user to check the console for more information. To open the console open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). In the console, the user can find a list of the topics we learned through prework. There is also a line that randomly suggests which topic to study first. Reloading the page changes this topic.
