        <h2>HTML</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage</li>

          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>

          <li>!DOCTYPE is not case-sensitive because it is a declaration. Declarations are not case-sensitive; 
            HTML elements are case-sensitive.</li>

          <li>The title tag is extremely important for search engine optimization (SEO).</li>

          <li>The body element is an example of a semantic HTML element. 
            In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage.</li>

          <li> An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag,
             whereas a tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>

          <li>When using headings, it is important that we use heading tags in order from h1 to h6 to make the page accessible 
            to users who access the page using screen readers or other devices. h1 should only appear once per page</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>

          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>

          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet</li>

          <li>Use inline CSS to style is used to style an element directly in the HTML file. Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, 
              using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only.</li>

          <li>Internal style sheets are embedded into an HTML file by using a style element in the head element.
              These CSS rules only apply to the page they are embedded in.</li>

          <li>external CSS style sheets are the preferred method in most cases because they allow developers to 
              keep all their CSS rules in a separate file</li>

          <li>a selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>

          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>

            <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>

            <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>

            <li>Multiple branches can exist at a time, each serving a different purpose.</li>
  
            <li>A feature branch might hold code that is currently being developed for a single feature of the application. 
                We call this a working branch.</li>
  
            <li>A developed branch can hold the code for multiple feature branches that have not been incorporated into the main branch yet.</li>
  
            <li>The default branch is called main and it should be the final, most updated version of the application.</li>
  
            <li>The work we do on the application should be done on feature branches through commits.</li>
  
            <li>Adding the word feature to a branch name is a useful convention which communicates to our 
                teammates that our branch is adding a new feature. I.e “feature/starter-code”.</li>
  
            <li>Commit messages should be written as imperative commands in the present tense.</li>
