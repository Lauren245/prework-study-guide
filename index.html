        <ul>

          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage</li>

          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>

          <li>!DOCTYPE is not case-sensitive because it is a declaration. Declarations are not case-sensitive; 
            HTML elements are case-sensitive.</li>

          <li>The title tag is extremely important for search engine optimization (SEO).</li>

          <li>The body element is an example of a semantic HTML element. 
            In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage.</li>

          <li> An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag,
             whereas a tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>

          <li>When using headings, it is important that we use heading tags in order from h1 to h6 to make the page accessible 
            to users who access the page using screen readers or other devices. h1 should only appear once per page</li>

            <li>Multiple branches can exist at a time, each serving a different purpose.</li>
  
            <li>A feature branch might hold code that is currently being developed for a single feature of the application. 
                We call this a working branch.</li>
  
            <li>A developed branch can hold the code for multiple feature branches that have not been incorporated into the main branch yet.</li>
  
            <li>The default branch is called main and it should be the final, most updated version of the application.</li>
  
            <li>The work we do on the application should be done on feature branches through commits.</li>
  
            <li>Adding the word feature to a branch name is a useful convention which communicates to our 
                teammates that our branch is adding a new feature. I.e “feature/starter-code”.</li>
  
            <li>Commit messages should be written as imperative commands in the present tense.</li>
